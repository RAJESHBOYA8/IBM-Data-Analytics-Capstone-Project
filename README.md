# IBM Data Analytics Capstone Project

Welcome to the IBM Data Analytics Capstone Project repository, where I demonstrate the skills gained through the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program on Coursera. 
This project focuses on solving a real-world business problem by leveraging data analytics techniques to derive meaningful insights.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

The objective of this capstone is to apply various data analysis skills to a given dataset, analyze patterns, and provide actionable insights for a business scenario. The project involves:

1. Data Acquisition and Cleaning: Sourcing and preparing data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key trends, outliers, and data patterns using statistical methods.
3. Data Visualization: Using visual tools to present data findings in a clear, concise, and impactful manner.
4. Insights and Recommendations: Offering data-driven suggestions to address the business problem.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, NumPy): For data manipulation and processing.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: For creating visualizations to illustrate insights.
- SQL: Used to query and analyze datasets.
- Jupyter Notebook: Documenting the data analysis workflow.
## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learning Outcomes

- Data Cleaning and Wrangling: Mastery of transforming raw data into an analyzable format.
- Exploratory Analysis: Identifying trends, correlations, and key statistics.
- Effective Data Visualization: Crafting visuals to communicate findings.
- Business Recommendations: Translating analytical results into actionable strategies.
